# Notebook

This is a repository for a simple Notebook app that I created while learning Laravel and Vue.

Feel free to take a look around the codebase.

## Installation & Configuration
If you would like to install this project, treat it as you would any other Laravel application.
*Make sure you set the ```APP_ENV``` environment variable to ```production``` when the app is on a live sever, to force HTTPS connections on all routes.*
